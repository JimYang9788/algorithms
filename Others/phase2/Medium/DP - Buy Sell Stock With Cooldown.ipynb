    "        1. In general dynamic programming concept, we store maxprofit found till that index in dp[i], but this problem has many states i) buy ii) sell iii) cooldown \n",

    "        2. if in case of multiple states, what we do in (say DP state machine pattern) is we store maximum for all the possible states i.e\n",

    "            a) dp_buy[i] = we are buying on that day. But as per question you can only buy when previous day is cooldown. so only consider dp_cooldown[i-1] and also buying on day i, will cost you some money i.e price[i]. can be written as:\n",

    "            c) dp_sell[i] = before selling you have to buy, so we have to get max of previous_buy value from o to i. Instead of looping 0 to i, we can simply keep a max_prev_buy variable and keep track of it. And also by selling you are getting money i.e prices[i] so add prices[i] to max_prev_buy\n",
