### c++ 写题细节

1. Sorting 

   ``sort（a.begin(),a.end(),comparator)`` 是sort vector的常规方法，记得comparator function需要return boolean, 并需要是一个``static function `` 

   (A **static function** is a member function of a class that can be called even when an object of the class is not initialized. A static function cannot access any variable of its class except for **static variables**.)
